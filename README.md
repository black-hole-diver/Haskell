# Haskell
This is a repository to practice and learn my favorite programming language "Haskell", hope you enjoy the journey with me, my dear visitors!

The aim of this repository of mine is to master the Haskell language, in which I could write a Software in the future based on Haskell.
This language is such a beautiful and eligant language with its uniqueness and complexity.

I learned this language by studying from
"Haskell Tutorial by Derek Banas"
"Haskell Learning from First Principles"
"Wikibooks"
"Concurrent clean principles"
